# Introduction: Mind over Data

Book mission:
1. to lay in nonmathematical language the intellectual content of the Causal Revolution and how it
is affecting our lives as well as our future;
1. to share some of the heroic journeys, both successful and failed, that scientists have embarked on when confronted by critical cause-effect questions.
2. to describe how robots can be constructed that learn to communicate in our mother tongueâ€”the language of cause and effect

> "The human brain is the most advanced tool ever devised for managing causes and effects (...) Data is profoundly dumb. Data do not understand causes and effects; humans do."

Calculus of causation consists of two languages: 
- Causal diagrams, to express what we know
- A symbolic language (resembling algebra), to express what we want to know

The *do*-operator signifies that we are dealing with an intervention rather than a passive observation

## A Blueprint of Reality

We collect data only after:
- we posit the causal model
- we state the scientific query we wish to answer
- we derive the estimand

Information about the effects of actions or interventions is simply not available in raw data, unless it is collected by controlled experimental manipulation

> "If we ever want robots to answer 'Why?' questions or even understand what they mean, we must equip them with a causal model and teach them how to answer counterfactual queries"
